enterprise county wide project and posed the idea that they should move from selling software to renting it via an up and coming model saas. today, everyone is using saas products and paying monthly for various products but in 2004 (when i initially made the proposal) it was an exciting and new potential market which i leveraged to increase the returns at adsystech and most importantly, generate new recurring revenue. i was hired in 05 to put in place all things saas, this included designing a data center from the ground up, creating cyber security policies and controls, putting together a team to support the data center as well as a team to provide technical support for the new product offering. as an early adopter, in 2008 i designed and deployed a hybrid cloud environment in our data center. again in 08 this was a new technology but my decision demonstrates foresight in emerging technologies and understand in the value of leveraging technology to become more efficient and financial prudent. im very proud of the work ive done and adsystech, below are some key areas in my control: network design monitoring and maintenance cloud technologies cyber security (nits, cis,

experience 09/2010 to 09/2011 information technology analyst company name i believe that each child has their own potential and interests and curiosity in learning. designing an organized classroom setup, positive and welcoming, caring and secured, safe-risk taking, theme based, and discussions on their interests during class meetings would create warm atmosphere and environment to grow in every domain of development socially, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. i believe the teacher needs to be a supportive person as well as a guide in providing the information, and plans for hands on activities with tools and materials that help them for self-discovery and understand the lesson in curriculum. letting kids be kids and have freedom to express their own thoughts and creativity and valuing them. my personal goal for my future classroom is to grow their potential and interests in their own pace without pressurizing with targets. students should be given information on where to find the answers and given the opportunity to explore the solution rather than giving the direct answers, this gives the space for exploration and creativity. i would have the strong idea on having the curriculum inclusive of each childs needs and interests. curriculum plan involving group work, which is the key for the student led jobs, and direction to help others, teach respect for others and themselves. motivation and stimulation are the factors that pull out the full potential of the child. recording their interests and motivated ideas of every student periodically, and sharing with the parents and caregivers to engage the children. giving the base line of the activity and watching them on how they expand and give new dimension for more than we thought which is a great feeling. giving the ownership to the children yields mutual trust, support, and love between teacher and child. developing trust, love and respect for themselves and others help avoid bullying and hurtful words/actions. make the point that, every child should be treated consistent, equal, fair and approachable. giving them the time and space to explore along with spending valuable time with them promotes the emotional development as they spend more time in school than any other place. i believe in the quote a strong body makes the mind strong and strong mind makes a body strong, i would encourage more of the outdoor activities during the supporting weather. i feel interaction among peers, conflict resolution, turn taking, creativity, helping others, teaching love and respect can be achieved more in outdoor group activities. a healthy meal plan are one main criteria in making sure they have a balanced diet every meal they eat, lots of fruits and vegetables, dairy foods, and less sodium and sugar. i would be compassionate, dedicated, and continue learn and strive to give the best part to my children as a future teacher. i understand teaching involves regulations, restrictions, and responsibilities, as with any other job but this comes with the package of cherishing moments, excitement, joy of being with the innocent and laughing children. enjoy students and everything they do and accept them as they are, that would be the best gift we give the children who come to school leaving the parents. my philosophy may grow in the future with experience and continued learning and welcoming the ideas and knowledge from work place. 01/2010 to 08/2010 technology analyst company name 10/2006 to 06/2008 software engineer company name 07/2004 to 10/2006 project engineer company name
